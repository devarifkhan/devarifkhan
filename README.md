In the armory of my experience, you’ll find tools forged in the fires of real-world combat. Each skill is a finely honed weapon, sharpened by countless battles fought in the field of code.

- **Arcane Arts**: Apache Kafka, Keycloak Authorization Server, AWS (Lambda, SQS, SNS, DynamoDB, API Gateway)
- **Blades of Choice**: Java, Python, Node.js, .NET
- **Alchemical Potions**: REST APIs, Event-Driven Architecture, Cloud-Native Applications
- **Shield of Resilience**: Docker, Kubernetes, Microservices Architecture
- **Advanced Arsenal**: Eureka Server, API Gateway, Resilience4j (Circuit Breakers, Load Balancing, Retry Mechanisms)
- **Mapping the Unknown**: SQL (PostgreSQL), NoSQL (MongoDB, DynamoDB)

With these in hand, no challenge is too great, no system too complex.
